# Challenge 1: Dependency Relationship

1. Create a `Logger` class with a function `logMessage` that receives a message and outputs that message to standard out. This class should be properly split into header and source files.
2. Modify the `Car` class from the Interface and Implementation content to use (dependency) the `Logger` class for logging when a price change occurs inside `setPrice`.
3. This should replace the `printPriceChange` function, so you can remove this function from the `Car` class.
