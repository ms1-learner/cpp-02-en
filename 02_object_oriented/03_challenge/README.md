# Challenge 3: Aggregation Relationship

1. Create a `Garage` class that can hold multiple `Car`s. This class should be properly split into header and source files.
2. Implement methods `addCar` for adding and `removeCar` for removing `Car`s from the `Garage`.
3. Use `std::vector<Car>` to manage the `Car`s within the `Garage`.
4. Demonstrate the relationship by making a `Garage` object and adding and removing `Car` objects.
