# Challenge 2: Association Relationship

1. Create a `Driver` class with `name` and `age` member variables. This class should be properly split into header and source files.
2. Add a `setDriver` method in the `Car` class that allows you to assign (association) a `Driver` to the `Car`.
3. Demonstrate the relationship by making a `Driver` object and assigning it to a `Car` object.
