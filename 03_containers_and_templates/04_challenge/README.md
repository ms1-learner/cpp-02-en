# Challenge 4

Design a program that reads a text file containing a list of names and phone numbers. The program should store the names and phone numbers in a `std::map` container. Implement the following features:

- Add a name and phone number to the map.
- Remove a name and its associated phone number from the map.
- Search for a phone number based on a given name.
- Display all names and phone numbers in alphabetical order.

In this challenge, you will need to research and understand how to use `std::map` and its associated functions. Also, you'll need to implement input validation and error handling to ensure the program works as expected.
