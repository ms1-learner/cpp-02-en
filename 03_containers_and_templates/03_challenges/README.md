# Challenge 3

Compare the performance of `std::vector`, `std::list`, and `std::deque` when used as the underlying data structure for a stack. Write a small program that performs a series of push and pop operations on a stack, then time the execution for each container type. Determine which container is the best choice for this application and explain your choice. Make sure to compile with -O0 so the compiler doesn't optimize away your code and result in useless benchmarks.
