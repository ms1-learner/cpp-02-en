# Challenge 1
Code your solution in the provided header and source files. Separate your interface and implementations. Your `main` function should go in `main.cpp`.

Create a scoped enum `TrafficLight` representing the colors of a traffic light: `red`, `yellow`, and `green`.

Complete the following function that takes a `TrafficLight` as an input and returns the action corresponding to the traffic light color as a string.

```cpp
std::string get_action(TrafficLight light) {
    // TODO
}
```

Input:

```cpp
TrafficLight::red
```

Output:

```cpp
"Stop"
```
