# Challenge 2
Code your solution in the provided header and source files. Separate your interface and implementations. Your `main` function should go in `main.cpp`.

Define a struct `Rectangle` with two float members: `width` and `height`. Write a function `rectangle_area` that takes a `Rectangle` object as input and returns its area.

Input:
