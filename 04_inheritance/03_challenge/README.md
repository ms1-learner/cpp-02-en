# Challenge 3

Create a base class named `Animal` with a public member function `makeSound()` that outputs "Unknown sound." Create a derived class named `Dog` that inherits from `Animal`. Override the `makeSound()` function in the `Dog` class to output "Woof!". Test the `Dog` class by creating an object and calling its `makeSound()` function.
